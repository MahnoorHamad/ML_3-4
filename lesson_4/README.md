# Lesson 4: Overfitting and Evaluation

This lesson explains **Overfitting** and techniques to evaluate and prevent it.

### Key Concepts
- **Overfitting**: Model learns noise/detail in training data â†’ poor generalization.
- **Learning Curves**: Plot train vs test error over time to detect overfitting.
- **Good Fit**: Sweet spot before test error starts to increase.

### Prevention Methods
- Reduce network size
- Cross-Validation
- Weight Regularization
- Remove irrelevant features
- Dropout
- Data Augmentation
